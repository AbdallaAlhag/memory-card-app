# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Future Possible Features~
- Loading page, work on loading components smoother
- difficulty (easy, med, hard -> 5, 10, 15 cards)and swap out cards instead of the same x amount like maybe swap out 2 for 2 new ones but keep those swapped out ones with their states
